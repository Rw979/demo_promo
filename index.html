      <h2> Lamo </h2>

      <p>Lamo is a Chinese photographer who is famous for his filtered photos. Many years ago, I was trying to find a wallpaper for my computer. His works showed up when I was searching. I love the yellow and blue vibe in his artwork. My ipad, mac and phones all use his works as wallpapers.<br><br>
        It’s hard to find information about Lamo on the Internet. For many people, his works are cheap and easy because he always uses the same filter for the photos. And these blue filters are actually not very hard to adjust even for normal people. Lamo is more like a merchant instead of a photographer. He has online courses teaching people how to take pictures like him. In some ways, there’s a reason that he receives many negative critics because his works look the same all these years and seem to have no improvements. But there’s no doubt he’s very smart and knows how to benefit from his work.
